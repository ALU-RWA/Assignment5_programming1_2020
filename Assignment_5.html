<h1>Assignment 5</h1>

Congratulations, you have made it this far :)<br>
This assignment is easy, because you are building on things that you already have done.<br>
This one has a bit of a lot of things to do but it is easy.<br>
In this assignment we are testing your understanding of classes, and whether you can design
and implement one correctly<br>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
Improve your car renting system for Mr Omondi, by using the car class.<br>
You are going to create a class for the Car object.<br>
What are the instance variables the car object has?<br>
What are the instance methods that it has ?<br>
I really do not care about how you do it, feel free to do this however works for you. Be creative.<br>
But here is the result that I want.<br>
The code to calculate the money made by each car, the number of times that a car has been in business,
renting, adding and removing a car from the car collection should be on a different file.<br>
other than the one containing your main program.<br>

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>
This question is worth 20 marks.<br>
The fact that you have your code on different files 5 marks.<br>
The car class 5 marks.<br>
Code working properly 5 marks.<br>
Cleanness of your code 5 marks (by cleanness I mean, well readable lines,not too long horizontally, <br>
code well commented, I can know what a function is doing before reading the code, <br>
and I can know what the file is about before reading the code in that file.<br>
This assignment is highly individual<br>

<h2>Question 2</h2>
Kigali height is looking for a new program to use in order to control its elevators.<br>
The program should have the following abilities: open the elevator, close the elevator,and move the elevator.<br>
By the start, the program tells the user the state of the elevator (either closed or opened)<br>
And it asks them the floor on which they are going to.<br>
When the elevator is coming to the user,(the user need to know where it is at each
state and whether the elevator is going up or down).<br>
The same goes for when the user is in the elevator.<br>
Then the program need to tell the user that they arrived to their destination.<br>
What are the classes that you are going to create? (think about this)<br>

<h3>Grading rubric</h3>
This question is worth 40 marks<br>
The fact that you have your code on different files is worth 5 marks.<br>
Code working properly 25 marks.<br>
You need to tell me how you went about testing this code 5 marks.<br>
Cleanness of your code 5 marks (by cleanness I mean, well readable lines,not too long horizontally,
code well commented, I can know what <br>a function is doing before reading the code,
and I can know what the file is about before reading the code in that file.<br>
This assignment is highly individual<br>

<h2>Question 3</h2>
Dangote has a lot of money.<br>
Dangote wants to open a bank.<br>
Each client has his own bank account.<br>
Each client can deposit money on their account, withdraw money from their account,view their bank balance <br>
and transfer money from their account to another client using Dangoteâ€™s bank.<br>
Please help Dangote.<br>
